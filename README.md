Assignment - Create Mathematical Tables from 3 to 20    

1a) Create Mathematical Tables from 3 to 20 through hard-coding   

3 * 1 = 3    
3 * 2 = 6     
3 * 3 = 9     
3 * 4 = 12     
3 * 5 = 15     
3 * 6 = 18     
3 * 7 = 21    
3 * 8 = 24    
3 * 9 = 27    
3 * 10 = 30          

4 * 1 = 4     
4 * 2 = 8     
.........    
4 * 10 = 40    


20 * 1 = 20     
20 * 2 = 40     
...........    
20 * 10 = 200.     

1b) Take input from the keyboard and generate the same result
start = input ("Enter first number")    
end = input ("Enter second number")    

1c) Take input from a file in1.txt containing 3 in first line and 8 in second line and generate the mathematical tables
3    
8     

1d) Take input from a file in2.txt containing 3,8 in the first line and generate the mathematical tables     
3,8    
   
1e) Send the results to an output file out1.txt.  Use "\n" wherever required to generate a new line. The file content should look same as the console output

1f) Send the results to 6 different output files 3.txt, 4.txt, 5.txt, 6.txt, 7.txt, 8.txt depending on the start and end values given as input.  ie. The output filename should be dynamically created for each and every mathematical table generated

1g) Using Python-Django, show the above Mathematical Tables from 3 to 8 as a dynamic HTML page like http://127.0.0.1:5000/tables.  The Python logic should be in a function inside views.py    

1h) Using Python-Django, take the inputs "start" and "end" as HTML Form inputs and generate the dynamic HTML page showing Mathematical Tables
